# HOW TO INSTALL DISCORD THEMES AND PLUGINS
Head over to BetterDiscord's website and download the latest version (https://betterdiscord.app). Run the installer, agree to terms, and then select which build of Discord you'd like to install BetterDiscord onto. Unless you're using a public test build version of Discord, you'll want to select the normal Discord option up top.

Once installed, Discord will restart and then you'll have a new bundle of options in the Discord User Settings menu under the banner BetterDiscord.

To install themes, head over to "Themes" in User Settings and click on "Open Themes Folder" at the top. This will open a file where you can drag or paste any themes files you download from BetterDiscord's themes library. It's really as easy as drag and drop hereâ€”once a theme file is added to the folder, it'll automatically be available in your Discord client (even if it's currently running). You'll find all installed themes listed under Themes in User Settings. Each one should have an on/off toggle in the upper right of its box, as well as edit and delete buttons in the lower right.

Correctly installed themes should look like this:
